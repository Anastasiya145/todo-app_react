## How does it work:
  - Can create a new `Todo` on submit (Enter) in the `input` field;
  - It shows the number of not completed (items left);
  - It shows a list of todos;
  - Can check the left side checkbox to determine if a todo is `completed` or `not completed`;
  - By clicking on the dropdown, you can mark all todos as `completed` or `not completed`;
  - Can switch the filter between `All`/`Active`/`Completed` todos;
  - Have the ability to remove a todo using the `destroy` button (`X`);
  - Have the ability to clear completed todos - remove all completed items from the list, by clicking on the `Clear completed` button;
  - You can edit the todo when you double-click on the TODO title;
  - It can keep the state of the APP between reloads.
